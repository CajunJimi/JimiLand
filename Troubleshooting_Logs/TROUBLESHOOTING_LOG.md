# Troubleshooting Log

## 2025-06-04: GitHub Actions Workflow Setup and Deployment Fix

### Issue Description
The GitHub Actions workflow was failing to build the site due to missing requirements.txt file and YAML syntax errors in the workflow file.

### Resolution Steps
1. Fixed YAML syntax errors in the GitHub Actions workflow file (.github/workflows/deploy.yml)
   - Removed problematic heredoc syntax that was causing parsing errors
   - Replaced with properly escaped echo commands
   - Split workflow into more focused steps for better organization

2. Created requirements.txt file with necessary dependencies:
   - notion-client
   - python-dotenv
   - Jinja2
   - requests
   - markdown
   - python-dateutil
   - pytz

3. Improved error handling in the workflow:
   - Added fallback mechanisms for file operations
   - Enhanced logging for better debugging
   - Added output directory structure verification

### Outcome
The GitHub Actions workflow should now run successfully, building and deploying the site to GitHub Pages with the custom domain jimi.land. The workflow includes fallback mechanisms to ensure the gigs page is always available, even if the build process encounters issues.

### Next Steps
1. Monitor the GitHub Actions workflow to ensure it completes successfully
2. Verify that the site is accessible at https://jimi.land/
3. Check that the gigs page and calendar page are properly displayed
4. Consider adding more comprehensive error handling and logging in the site generator
